# Node API Boilerplate

## Description

An API boilerplate with Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL and many more.

## Getting started

### Install dependencies

Execute `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Development environment

#### Start

Execute `npm run start` to run the development server on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** by default. You can pass whatever port you want, like `PORT=4000`.

After edit some files, you do not need to start the server again. Let to Nodemon do this for you.

### Production environment

#### Build

Execute `npm run build` to compile the files.

Use `npm run clean` first if you have already created the *dist* folder and then execute `npm run build` to make sure it is a new full compilation.

#### Start

Execute `npm run serve` to run the server and go to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. By default it will use port 3000, but you can pass whatever port you want, like `PORT=5000`.
